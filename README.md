# Analysis of earthquake recurrence

This project will study the mathematics of earthquake prediction based on mathematical and data modelling. 
This project will try to understand the mathematics behind the celebrated Gutenberg-Richter (GR) scaling law that shows how the frequency N of earthquakes is related to their magnitude: $log_{10} N = a-bM$, where N is the number of events with amplitude greater than or equal to M. 
The project will analyse the time evolution of the GR-law, studying time dependence of the parameters. 

## Project aim and objectives:
1. Understanding the mathematics behind earthquake modelling.
2. Analysing earthquake data across different regions and understand the generic behaviour.
3. Predicting future earthquakes combining continuum and data modelling.
